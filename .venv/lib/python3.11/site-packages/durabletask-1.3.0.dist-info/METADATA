This repo contains a Python SDK for use with the [Azure Durable Task Scheduler](https://github.com/Azure/Durable-Task-Scheduler). With this SDK, you can define, schedule, and manage durable orchestrations using ordinary Python code.

> Note that this SDK is **not** currently compatible with [Azure Durable Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview). If you are looking for a Python SDK for Azure Durable Functions, please see [this repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-durable-python).
